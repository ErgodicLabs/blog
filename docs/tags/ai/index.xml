      <description>&lt;p&gt;Yes, every app will become an AI app. But it won’t happen because every app adopts AI. It will happen because AI learns to be a power user of every app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The shape of AI products is changing. The user experience is no longer defined by screens and buttons. Models are becoming the user interface.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h3 id=&#34;last-cycle&#34;&gt;Last cycle&lt;/h3&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the last cycle, AI products looked like AI Dungeon, Jasper.ai, and GitHub Copilot. These apps didn’t expose models directly. Instead, they embedded them behind carefully constructed prompts and application-specific logic. The prompts were fixed and put the models on rails.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
