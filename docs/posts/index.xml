      <description>&lt;p&gt;Every time I sit down to program these days, there is an annoying thought in the back of my mind that I should be programming with AI.&#xA;While I have had some good experiences building things with Cursor and especially with Claude Code, I have also found that it is a waste&#xA;of my time to use them when working on complex programs using tools that I am very comfortable with.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The shape of AI products is changing. The user experience is no longer defined by screens and buttons. Models are becoming the user interface. The &lt;a href=&#34;https://modelcontextprotocol.io&#34;&gt;Model Context Protocol&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.anthropic.com/news/model-context-protocol&#34;&gt;released by Anthropic in November of 2024&lt;/a&gt;, is a clear signal of this mode shift.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Every app will become an AI app. That won’t change. But it won’t happen because every app adopts AI. It will happen because AI learns to be a power user of every app.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
